                        <p>
                            There is nothing a Scottish Fold–named for their folded ears–likes better than to be with their people, participating in whatever they are doing.

                            As the name implies, Scottish Folds come from Scotland, and they can all trace their ancestry back to a barn cat named Susie who had folded ears and worked as a mouser.

                            These cats are sensitive, expressive, and active. They love to play and are not the best cats to leave home alone. They prefer a companion–even another cat–to keep them company. If you can provide this loving feline with the attention they crave and keep up with their needs, they just might be the new furry family member you’re looking for.

                        <h1 class="cat_heading">History</h1>
                        <p>
                            Often, the creation of a new cat breed hinges on a natural genetic mutation that occurs unexpectedly in an otherwise ordinary cat. Such was the case with the Scottish Fold. Members of the breed today can all trace their heritage back to Susie, a white cat with unusual folded ears who earned her keep as a mouser in a barn in Scotland's Tayside region.

                            Susie might have lived her life in obscurity had she not been noticed in 1961 by a shepherd named William Ross who had an interest in cats. When Susie had kittens with a local tom, Ross acquired one of them, a female he named Snooks.

                            In the natural way of things, Snooks had kittens, and one, a male was bred to a British Shorthair. Thus began the development of what were first known as "lop-eared cats," later as Scottish Folds, a nod to their country of origin and their defining characteristic.

                            Other breeders became involved, and it was determined that the gene mutation for the fold was dominant, meaning that if one parent passed on a gene for straight ears and the other a gene for folded ears, the resulting kitten would have folded ears. A gene for long hair was another gift Susie passed on to her descendants. The longhaired variety is known as a Highland Fold in some associations.

                            Scottish Folds were first imported into the United States in 1971. By the mid-1970s, they had been recognized by most cat associations in North America. They can be outcrossed to American Shorthairs and British Shorthairs.

                            Ironically, they are not recognized as a breed in their country of origin over concerns that the folded ear might lead to ear infections or deafness and because of a related cartilage problem.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Size</h1>
                        <p>
                            Overall, the Scottish Fold is a medium-sized cat with a compact build.

                            Females tend to be about six to nine pounds in weight, while males tend to be about nine to 13 pounds. Many cats may be smaller or larger than average.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Personality</h1>
                        <p>
                            After their ears, the first thing you will notice about a Scottish Fold is their habit of posing in odd positions—flat out on the floor like a little frog, sitting up for all the world as if they were a meerkat on a nature program, or lying on their back, paws up in the air. And although you might assume that their ears are less mobile than those of other cats, such is not the case. Scottish Folds use those ears to communicate quite effectively, adding comments in a quiet, chirpy voice when necessary.

                            This is a smart, moderately active cat. The Scottish Fold enjoys teaser toys that test their agility and puzzle toys that challenge their intelligence. Their favorite activities include anything that involves human interaction.

                            There is nothing a Scottish Fold likes better than to be with their people, participating in whatever they are doing. They're a sweet cat who enjoys attention. The last thing they want is to be left alone for hours on end, so they're not the best choice unless someone is home during the day or you can give them the company of another cat.

                            Rest assured, however, that they will expect you to play with them when you get home from work or school--or at least sit down so they can get in a little lap time or curl up next to you while you watch television.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Health</h1>
                        <p>
                            Both pedigreed cats and mixed breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. A typical lifespan is 15 years. Problems that may affect the Scottish Fold include the following:

                            Degenerative joint disease, especially in the tail but also in the ankle and knee joints, causing pain or poor mobility. It’s important to handle the tail carefully if it has developed stiffness.
                            Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a form of heart disease, has been seen in the breed, but it has not yet been proven to be a heritable form of the disease.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Care</h1>
                        <p>
                            Comb the Scottish Fold’s coat weekly to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. A longhaired Fold may need to be groomed a couple of times a week to ensure that tangles don't develop.

                            Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Trim the nails every couple of weeks.

                            Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don't run the risk of spreading any infection.

                            Check the ears weekly, especially if they are tightly folded. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.

                            Keep the Scottish Fold's litter box spotlessly clean. Cats are very particular about bathroom hygiene, and a clean litter box will help to keep the coat clean, as well.

                            It's a good idea to keep a Scottish Fold as an indoor-only cat to protect them from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car. Scottish Folds who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such a beautiful cat without paying for it.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Coat Color And Grooming</h1>
                        <p>
                            With the way their small ears fit like a cap over their rounded head, the Scottish Fold is often described as resembling an owl. The ears range in appearance from a single fold, bent forward about halfway up the ear, to a double fold, somewhat tighter, and the triple fold, lying tight to the head, which is desirable for show cats.

                            Kittens are born with straight ears, which may or may not fold when they are about three weeks old. Wide open eyes gaze out at the world with a sweet expression. The medium-size body is also rounded, completed by a medium to long tail that sometimes ends in a rounded tip.

                            A shorthaired Fold has a dense, plush coat with a soft texture. The longhaired variety has medium-long to long fur with britches (longer fur on the upper thighs), toe tufts, a plumed tail, and tufts of fur on the ears. They may also have a ruff around the neck.

                            The Scottish Fold comes in a number of colors and patterns, including solid, tabby, tabby and white, bicolor, and particolor. Eye color depends on coat color. For instance, white and bicolor cats can have blue eyes or odd eyes (where each eye is a different color).
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Children and Other Pets</h1>
                        <p>
                            The friendly, laidback Scottish Fold is a perfect choice for families with children and cat-friendly dogs. They love the attention they receive from children who treat them politely and with respect, and they like to play and are capable of learning tricks.

                            They're happy to live with cat-friendly dogs, too, thanks to their amiable disposition. Introduce pets slowly and in controlled circumstances to ensure that they learn to get along together.
