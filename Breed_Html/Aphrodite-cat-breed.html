                        <h1 class="cat_heading">History</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Aphrodite Giant is a cat from Cyprus, where they're one of two naturally occurring breeds. It's often speculated that the breed was originally discovered living high up in the mountains, which accounts for their muscular physique and long legs that helped them master the terrain and stalk larger prey.

                            The cat's extra thick coat also helped them survive in cold mountain climates. The Aphrodite Giant is one of the world's oldest cat breeds, having been around for nearly 10,000 years.

                            In 2012, the World Cat Federation officially started to acknowledge the Aphrodite Giant.

                            These days, you may find Aphrodite Giants in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you!
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Size</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Aphrodite Giant is a large cat. As is always the case, exact size standards might vary.

                            Most male Aphrodite Giants weigh in at 15 to 24 pounds and most female Aphrodite Giants are between ten and 14 pounds.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Personality</h1>
                        <p>
                            There's no doubt about it: The Aphrodite Giant is a total gentle giant of a cat. These kitties are exceptionally affectionate and very quickly form very strong and lasting loving bonds with all of the humans in their life--and they do especially well with children.

                            The breed does best when living with a large and active family with a lot of activity going on around them. These cats love to feel as if they're part of the day's fun and games.

                            As a large cat with mountain dwelling history, the breed will require at least one cat tree to climb up and claim for their own, and the bigger their living space, the better it is for their welfare.

                            But while the Aphrodite Giant is definitely an athletic looking feline, you'll find that the breed also loves nothing more than to curl up on the couch with their favorite humans and nap the afternoon away.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Health</h1>
                        <p>
                            Aphrodite Giants are generally considered to be healthy cats; although, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your cat's vet.

                            Some of the more common health problems Aphrodite Giants suffer from include:<br>

                            - Ear infections<br>
                            - Obesity<br>
                            - Hairballs<br>
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Care</h1>
                        <p>
                            As with all cats, it's important to keep up your Aphrodite Giant's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your cat healthy.

                            The Aphrodite Giant is a smart cat. Along with providing a large enough space for the cat to enjoy living in, you'll need to ensure that there are smart toys to keep the breed mentally stimulated. Interactive treat toys are ideal, and due to the cat's history living in the mountains and stalking prey, you should look for feeding stations that require the cat to figure out how to gain access to their food.

                            Along with scheduling yearly wellness vet visits, your Aphrodite Giant will need their nails checked on a regular basis. Ask your vet how best to do this if you're new to feline maintenance. Access to a scratching post or station--whether made of corrugated cardboard or sisal--is also imperative.

                            Beyond nail care, you'll want to examine the cat's ears for signs of dirt building up or possible infection, and clean them if needed. Also, make sure to speak to your regular vet about a teeth brushing regimen for your Aphrodite Giant.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Coat Color And Grooming</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Aphrodite Giant's coat can come in a wide array of colors, although it's never been spotted in chocolate, lilac, or mink.

                            The Aphrodite Giant can be either a short-haired or a long-haired cat. Which variety you adopt will determine how often you'll need to brush the thick coat. For long-haired cats, this should be carried out every other day. Proper brushing will also help ward off the chances of hairballs.

                            As with all breeds, keep a close eye out for any mats that might be starting to develop while you're grooming the cat. Remember, regular brushing will help keep the cat's coat clean and healthy!

                            When it comes to weather, the Aphrodite Giant is generally seen as an adaptable cat who can normally live happily in most climates, and their thicker-than-usual coat means they do better than most felines in cold conditions. Just remember to always make sure adequate shade and fresh water is provided when the temperature spikes.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Children and Other Pets</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Aphrodite Giant fares great when living with children. The cat will form loving bonds with the kids in your home. Just be sure that early socialization takes place and boundaries are properly set on both sides--and supervise early interactions between kids and cats.

                            When it comes to other household pets, the Aphrodite Giant is usually fine around other domestic animals. Although, you'll want to supervise early interactions between the new cat and existing pets.

                            Ultimately, early socialization really pays off with this breed. Make sure to reward your Aphrodite Giant for good behavior when you bring them home to your family.
