                        <h1 class="cat_heading">History</h1>
                        <p>
                            The first litter of Bambino kittens was officially registered in 2005 after Stephanie and Pat Osborne bred the hairless Sphynx with the short-legged Munchkin. The cat's name translates to "baby" in Italian, which pays homage to their small and kittenish size. As a comparatively new mixed cat breed, the Bambino's history is still being established.

                            The Bambino was officially acknowledge as an experimental new breed by the International Cat Association (TICA) in 2006.

                            These days, you may find Bambinos in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. So make sure to consider adoption if you decide that this is the mixed breed for you!
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Size</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Bambino is a small cat. As is always the case, exact size standards might vary.

                            Most Bambinos weigh in at five to nine pounds and most female Bambinos are between four and seven pounds. That said, many may be smaller or larger than average.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Personality</h1>
                        <p>
                            When it comes to summing up the Bambino's personality, the first thing you'll want to take note of is just how playful and even a little mischievous the mixed breed is. This is a cat who will happily spend as much time as possible playing with toys and exploring every nook and cranny of their environment.

                            It's advised to make sure your home is big enough to satisfy the cat's playful instincts. Interactive toys should be left out and rotated on a regular basis, while at least one cat tree will be required to add variety to play sessions.

                            Balancing out the Bambino's personality, the mixed breed's playful side is complimented by their affectionate nature--this is a kitty who very easily forms bonds with the humans in their life and loves to follow up a frantic playtime with a calm and leisurely snuggle session on the couch or bed.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Health</h1>
                        <p>
                            Bambinos are generally considered to be healthy cats; although, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your cat's vet. While most Bambinos are healthy, they can become prone to some of the same conditions that the Sphynx and Munchkin breeds also face.

                            Some of the more common health problems Bambinos suffer from include:

                            Pectus Excavatum
                            Skin conditions
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Care</h1>
                        <p>
                            As with all cats, it's important to keep up your Bambino's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your cat healthy.

                            Along with scheduling yearly wellness vet visits, it is strongly recommended that you add a scratching post to your living environment. This can help promote healthy scratching and keep the cat's nails in good condition.

                            The Bambino's ears should also be examined regularly for signs of dirt building up or possible infection. Talk with your vet about starting a regular teeth brushing regimen that will suit your Bambino, as well.

                            As with any breed that has high energy levels, the Bambino will need enough living space to be able to run around and play, including either a cat tree or safe furniture that they can climb up and down.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Coat Color And Grooming</h1>
                        <p>
                            The hairless Bambino usually comes in a light cream or darker black color. Due to the mixed breed's lack of fur, the Bambino is often considered to be a hypoallergenic cat and can be a good fit for someone who suffers from cat allergies.

                            When it comes to grooming, the main maintenance requirement when caring for a Bambino is to make sure to bathe the cat regularly. This is because the hairless mixed breed doesn't posses the fur that usually absorbs the oils a cat's skin makes. Speak to your vet about the precise frequency of cat baths, and which products are safe and suitable for your feline.

                            When it comes to climate, the Bambino is generally an adaptable cat, although due to their hairless nature you should consider using sunscreen in summer and adding a cat vest in winter if it gets exceptionally cold. The Bambino definitely does better living as an indoors cat.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Children and Other Pets</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Bambino is a great fit if you have children, especially young ones. The mixed breed has a playful and loving nature that will see them forming close bonds with the kids in their life. Just be sure that early socialization takes place and boundaries are properly set on both sides, and supervise early interactions between kids and cats.

                            When it comes to other household pets, the Bambino is usually okay living alongside other domestic animals. Although you'll want to supervise early interactions between the new cat and existing pets.

                            Ultimately, early socialization really pays off with this mixed breed. Make sure to reward your Bambino for good behavior when you bring them home to your family!
