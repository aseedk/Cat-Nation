                        <p>The Aegean is a great family cat, with their social disposition credited to their history as one of the oldest ever domestic cat breeds around. They’re brave and intelligent kitties who get on well with kids. Although, as the breed isn’t afraid of water, it’s not normally a great idea to adopt a cat of this breed if you have a fish tank at home.</p>

                        <h1 class="cat_heading">History</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Aegean cat breed hails from the Greek islands of Cyclades, which are situated in the Aegean Sea. It's speculated that originating so close to the sea is why these felines are not afraid of water.

                            The breed's friendliness towards humans is also said to come from their upbringing, being around sailors and fishermen all the time. In Greece, the Aegean is a super popular cat breed, although it is rarer to come across them in other countries.

                            If you're considering adding an Aegean to your family, remember that many have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you!
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Size</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Aegean is a medium-sized cat. As is often the case with cat breeds, exact size standards might vary.

                            Most male Aegean cats weigh in at nine to ten pounds and most female Aegeans are between seven and nine pounds.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Personality</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Aegean cat is one of the most friendly and sociable cat breeds around. They make great additions to any large family and will constantly look to seek out human interaction, whether that's to relax together during down times or for energetic play sessions.

                            These athletic cats are also highly intelligent--in many cases Aegeans have been taught to perform tricks. While the Aegean has an independent streak, they do best in a bustling household where there's always activity going on that the cat can check out. This breed loves to be part of the action!

                            The Aegean also has a love of being outdoors, so if you can provide a safely-enclosed catio, they'll very much appreciate it. Just be warned: Due to Aegeans being part of a rare group of cats who enjoy water, they might come to see any pet fish as an opportunity for a snack session.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Health</h1>
                        <p>
                            Aegeans are generally considered to be healthy cats--and to date there are not any breed specific health issues associated with the cat.

                            Although, as with any breed, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your cat's vet.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Care</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Aegean cat has a well deserved reputation as a smart and athletic feline, so you'll need to ensure that the breed is always kept physically and mentally stimulated.

                            Ideally, you'll want to purchase a cat tree for your Aegean to interact with, and if you live in an environment with furniture that the cat can safely climb up and down, they will very much appreciate the opportunity to explore.

                            Leaving smart toys and interactive treat dispensers around the home is also a great way to keep the Aegean mentally stimulated.

                            Along with scheduling yearly wellness vet visits, your Aegean will need their nails checked on a regular basis. Ask your vet how best to do this if you're new to feline maintenance. You'll also want to examine the cat's ears for signs of dirt building up or possible infection, and clean them if needed.

                            Also, make sure to speak to your regular vet about a teeth brushing regimen for your Aegean.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Coat Color And Grooming</h1>
                        <p>
                            The main color of the Aegean's coat is white, and it usually has spots and markings in colors including black, gray, and blue. The markings on the cat vary on an individual basis.

                            The Aegeon is relatively low maintenance when it comes to grooming, although their plush coat will get thicker in winter. Shedding is mostly moderate, and brushing the breed a couple of time a week should suffice.

                            As with all breeds, keep a close eye out for any mats that might be starting to develop while you're grooming the cat. Remember, regular brushing will help keep the cat's coat clean and healthy.

                            When it comes to climate, the Aegean is a generally seen as an adaptable cat who can usually live happily in most climates. Just remember to always make sure adequate shade and fresh water is provided when the temperature spikes.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Children and Other Pets</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Aegean is wonderful with children. The cat will quickly form loving bonds with the kids in your home. Just be sure that early socialization takes place and boundaries are properly set on both sides--and supervise early interactions between kids and cats.

                            When it comes to other household pets, the Aegean is also usually fine around other domestic animals--although, as mentioned above, this is not a cat to leave unsupervised around fish or other water-based pets.

                            Ultimately, early socialization really pays off with this breed. Make sure to reward your Aegean for good behavior and adhere to a proper training regime when you bring them home to your family.
