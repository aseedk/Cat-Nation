                        <h1 class="cat_heading">History</h1>
                        <p>
                            When it comes to the history of the British Longhair, it all begins with the parent breed that gives these cats their names--British Shorthair. At some point widely speculated to be between 1914 and 1918, breeders began to cross the British Shorthairs with the Persians in a bid to produce a kitty with longer hair. The British Longhair was the result, and the breed has prospered as a super popular domestic cat ever since!

                            In 2009, the British Longhair was officially granted championship status by the International Cat Association (TICA).

                            These days, you may find British Longhairs in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you!
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Size</h1>
                        <p>
                            The British Longhair is a medium- to large-sized cat breed who's often a little on the stockier side. As is always the case, exact size standards might vary.

                            Most British Longhairs weigh in at nine to 18 pounds. That said, many may be smaller or larger than average.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Personality</h1>
                        <p>
                            At heart, the British Longhair is a loving and friendly cat who will also show a great deal of tolerance. They are sociable towards people when they're around, but the breed is also happy to enjoy their own time, which makes them a smart choice for someone who might be away from the home for long hours due to work commitments.

                            While there is a laid-back nature about the British Shorthair, it's important to encourage the breed to stay active and engage in exercise. Think of the British Longhair as a breed of cat that you'll need to invest some time and effort in when you're around them to get the best out of them.

                            Also note that the British Longhair is an affectionate cat, but they do not generally enjoy being picked up or carried around. They are a breed that might be better suited to adult lifestyles rather than a home buzzing with kids all the time.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Health</h1>
                        <p>
                            British Longhairs are generally considered to be healthy cats; although, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your cat's vet.

                            Some of the more common health problems British Longhairs suffer from include:<br>

                            - Renal Polycystosis<br>
                            - Neonatal Isoerythrolysis<br>
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Care</h1>
                        <p>
                            The British Longhair needs a little coaxing to make sure they remain active and engage in enough exercise. Otherwise, feline obesity and other related health issues might set in.

                            A smart way to encourage the breed to exercise is through the use of treat-based games and play sessions. Also, consider interactive feeding devices if it seems like your British Longhair is becoming a little too much of a lounge cat.

                            Along with scheduling yearly wellness vet visits, your British Longhair will need to have their nails checked and trimmed on a regular basis. If you're new to cat maintenance, your vet can show you the safest way to carry this out. Adding a scratching post to your living environment can also help promote healthy scratching and keep the cat's nails in good condition.

                            Beyond nail care, examine the British Longhair's ears for signs of dirt building up or possible infection every couple of weeks. It's also smart to speak to your vet about beginning a regular teeth brushing regimen that will suit your British Longhair.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Coat Color And Grooming</h1>
                        <p>
                            The British Longhair's coat can come in a wide range of colors, although blue is the most popular shade. Other frequent colors include tabby, white, cream, and black.

                            As the name suggests, the British Longhair is a long-haired cat whose luxurious coat will require a commitment to daily brushing. This is imperative to help ward off any mats forming, and during times of seasonal shedding, you'll need to engage in longer than usual brushing sessions. Regular grooming will also lessen the chances of hairballs occurring.

                            When it comes to climate, the British Longhair is generally seen as an adaptable cat who can usually live happily in most climates. Just remember to always make sure adequate shade and fresh water is provided when the temperature spikes.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Children and Other Pets</h1>
                        <p>
                            The British Longhair can live happily with children. Although, this generally tolerant cat often doesn't take well to being picked up and carried around. So be sure that early socialization takes place and boundaries are properly set on both sides, and supervise early interactions between kids and cats.

                            When it comes to other household pets, the British Longhair is usually fine sharing living quarters. However, you'll want to supervise early interactions between the new cat and existing pets, as well.

                            Ultimately, early socialization really pays off with this breed. Make sure to reward your British Longhair for good behavior when you bring them home to your family!
