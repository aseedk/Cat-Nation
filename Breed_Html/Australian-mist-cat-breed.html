                        <h1 class="cat_heading">History</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Australian Mist was originally developed back in 1977 by a doctor named Truda Straede. The intention behind the mixed breed was to develop a cat that would be content to stay indoors, along with having a mellow personality and easy going nature.

                            These days, the Australian Mist has become honored as Australia's national cat! In 1998, the breed's name was changed from the Spotted Mist to the Australian Mist.

                            The Australian Mist was officially accepted as having gained championship status by the International Cat Association (TICA) in 2014.

                            These days, you can find Australian Mists in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. So make sure to consider adoption if you decide that this is the breed for you!
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Size</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Australian Mist is a medium sized cat. As is always the case, exact size standards might vary.

                            Most Australian Mists weigh in at eight to 15 pounds. Female Australian Mists are often slightly smaller than their male counterparts. That said, many of these mixed breed cats can be smaller or larger than average.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Personality</h1>
                        <p>
                            When people talk about the personality of their Australian Mist cats, they usually say that they're mellow and tolerant kitties with an exceptionally loving side. These cats adore human interaction and attention and will often follow you around or hop up on your lap at any opportunity.

                            If you're after a cat who snuggles, this is an excellent mixed breed to consider. As the Australian Mist was originally developed to be an indoor cat, they're pretty adaptable to most living situations. Just be sure that you provide enough smart interactive toys and pieces of cat-friendly furniture around the home environment to ensure that the feline doesn't become bored or frustrated.

                            Due to the mixed breed's very tolerant nature, they also do really well living in an active household and are fine with lots of children around the place. It's often remarked that the Australian Mist is a cat who enjoys being handled and will rarely scratch.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Health</h1>
                        <p>
                            Australian Mists are generally considered to be healthy cats; although, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your cat's vet.

                            There aren't any breed-specific health problems associated with the Australian Mist, but always keep an eye out for signs that your cat might be in distress or pain.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Care</h1>
                        <p>
                            As with all cats, it's important to keep up your Australian Mist's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your cat healthy.

                            Along with scheduling yearly wellness vet visits, your Australian Mist will need to have their nails checked and trimmed on a regular basis. If you're new to cat adoption, your vet can show you the safest way to carry this out. Adding a scratching post to your living environment can also help promote healthy scratching and keep the cat's nails in good condition.

                            Beyond nail care, examine the Australian Mist's ears for signs of dirt building up or possible infection every couple of weeks. It's also advisable to talk with your vet about starting a regular teeth brushing regimen that will suit your Australian Mist.

                            While the Australian Mist is fine with living indoors, they can also become prone to obesity. So monitor snacks and treats, and consider adding a smart feeder to help aid the cat's portion control.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Coat Color And Grooming</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Australian Mist's coat is usually seen in a range of colors that include golden, chocolate brown, blue, and peach. Their coat can be spotted or have marbled patterns running through it.

                            When it comes to grooming, the Australian Mist is a low maintenance feline. Their short and glossy coat can be brushed once a week. This will not only help ward off the chance of any mats forming, but also keep the coat in clean and healthy condition. Maintaining a regular brushing routine also helps to lessen the likelihood that hairballs will be an issue for the feline.

                            The Australian Mist is generally seen as an adaptable cat who can usually live happily in most climates. Just remember to always make sure adequate shade and fresh water is provided when the temperature spikes.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Children and Other Pets</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Australian Mist is a perfect cat to bring into your home if you already have children. These are tolerant and loving cats. Just be sure that early socialization takes place and boundaries are properly set on both sides, and supervise early interactions between kids and cats.

                            When it comes to other household pets, the Australian Mist is usually okay living alongside other domestic animals. Although, you'll want to supervise early interactions between the new cat and existing pets, as well.

                            Ultimately, early socialization really pays off with this mixed breed. Make sure to reward your Australian Mist for good behavior when you bring them home to your family!
