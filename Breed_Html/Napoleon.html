                            The Napoleon cat is a mixed breed cat–a cross between the Munchkin and Persian cat breeds. Loving, playful, and sweet, these felines inherited some of the best traits from their parents.

                            This mixed breed is also sometimes known as the Minuet cat. You can find these cats in shelters and breed specific rescues, so remember to always adopt! Don’t shop if you’re looking to add one of these kitties to your home!

                            The Napoleon mixed breed absolutely adores being around people! These felines bond strongly with the humans in their lives and even love being around young children. Just remember that they do not do well when left alone for long periods of the day. So make sure you have an active household if you’re considering adopting one of these cats!

                        <h1 class="cat_heading">History</h1>
                        <p>
                            If you dig deep into the history of the Napoleon, you'll discover that this dwarf kitty dates back to 1996.

                            Their origin story involves a dog breeder by the name of Joe Smith who decided to breed a cat based on the Munchkin and Persian breeds after he saw a Wall Street Journal article about Munchkin cats.

                            Later on, another breeder named Teri Harris helped to popularize the Napoleon.

                            The Napoleon was officially acknowledged by the International Cat Association (TICA) in 2011.

                            These days, you can find Napoleons in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. So make sure to consider adoption if you decide that this is the mixed breed for you!
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Size</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Napoleon is a small cat. As is always the case, exact size standards might vary.

                            Most Napoleons weigh in at five to nine pounds. That said, many may be smaller or larger than average.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Personality</h1>
                        <p>
                            If you talk to the owner of a Napoleon cat, you'll very quickly hear them go on about just how loving and people-focused these felines are. In fact, when living with a Napoleon cat, you can expect the kitty to follow you around and want to snuggle up with you at any opportunity.

                            They also do great with kids and will bond very easily with humans. Just remember that the Napoleon is such a sociable kitty that they really need to be around people as much as possible, so consider another breed of cat if you're going to be away from the house for long periods of the day.

                            Beyond being a total cuddle bug, the Napoleon also has a playful and curious side. They might not be the most athletic jumpers, mainly due to their short legs, but they are always up for a play session. It's best to add some interactive toys to the living environment to keep your cat mentally stimulated.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Health</h1>
                        <p>
                            Napoleons are generally considered to be healthy cats; although, they can be predisposed to the same conditions that the Munchkin and Persian breeds face. As always, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your cat's vet.

                            Some of the more common health problems Napoleons suffer from include:

                            Cataracts
                            Lordosis
                            Polycystic kidney disease
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Care</h1>
                        <p>
                            As with all cats, it's important to keep up your Napoleon's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your cat healthy.

                            Beyond scheduling yearly wellness visits with your vet, make sure that you pick up a scratching post for your Napoleon cat's living environment. This can help promote healthy scratching and keep the cat's nails in good condition.

                            The mixed breed's ears should also be examined regularly for signs of dirt building up or possible infection. Talk to your vet about starting a regular teeth brushing regime that will suit your Napoleon. Your vet can advise you about specific brands and techniques.

                            Finally, because the Napoleon is a cat with a quite high energy level, make sure you provide enough space for them to scamper around!
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Coat Color And Grooming</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Napoleon cat comes in a very large range of colors. In fact, pretty much any color and combination goes with this kitty!

                            When it comes to grooming, it will depend on whether your Napoleon cat is long or short-haired. While a short-haired Napoleon will make do with weekly brushing sessions, a long-haired feline will need much more attention.

                            Brushing a long-haired Napoleon four or five times a week will really help ward off the chances of mats forming.

                            In terms of climate, most Napoleon cats are adaptable. You should also always make sure that there's enough shade and fresh water available during the hotter months.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Children and Other Pets</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Napoleon gets along great with young children. Just make sure that early socialization takes place and boundaries are properly set on both sides. Supervise early interactions between kids and cats.

                            When it comes to other household pets, the good-natured Napoleon usually fares well with many domestic animals. But always supervise early interactions between the new cat and existing pets. Sometimes these relationships are very much dependent on the individual pets' personalities.

                            Ultimately, early socialization really pays off with this mixed breed. Make sure to reward your Napoleon for good behavior when you bring them home to your family!
