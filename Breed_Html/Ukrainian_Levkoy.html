                        <h1><img class="sn-img" src="../img/Breed%20Cats/350x223_Ukrainian_Levkoy.jpg" alt = ""></h1>
                        <p>
                            The Ukrainian Levkoy is a mixed breed cat–a cross between the Donskoy and Scottish Fold breeds. These felines are known for being inquisitive, playful, and affectionate.

                            You may find these cats in shelters and rescues, so remember to adopt! Don’t shop if you’re looking to add one of these cats to your home!

                            The Ukrainian Levkoy is an almost hairless mixed breed that originated in Russia. On a day to day basis, these cats make excellent household pets, especially because they love to hang around and play with children. They also do well in smaller living environments, making them a good fit for apartment dwellers. Just remember that a hairless cat can require a little more in the way of maintenance than a short or long-haired kitty.

                        <h1 class="cat_heading">History</h1>
                        <p>
                            The history of the Ukrainian Levkoy dates back to 2004 when a Russian breeder named Elena Vsevolodovna Birjukova tried breeding the Donskoy cat with the Scottish Fold. The result was the Ukrainian Levkoy, which possesses the hairless nature of the former parent breed and the distinctive folded over ears of the latter.

                            The name Ukrainian Levkoy was chosen due to the way the mixed breed's ears seem like they are bent over, just like the leaves of the Levkoy plant.

                            These days, you may find Ukrainian Levkoys in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. So make sure to consider adoption if you decide that this is the mixed breed for you!
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Size</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Ukrainian Levkoy is a medium cat. As is always the case, exact size standards might vary.

                            Most Ukrainian Levkoys weigh between eight and twelve pounds, with the females often being noticeably smaller than the males.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Personality</h1>
                        <p>
                            You'll immediately notice that the Ukrainian Levkoy is super inquisitive and highly curious. They love to explore every nook and cranny of their immediate environment.

                            It's important that you can provide enough variety in their world, which might include moving around cat trees or scratching posts, and you'll also want to invest in some smart interactive toys to keep them intellectually interested.

                            The Ukrainian Levkoy has a strong play instinct, which is great news if you have children or other pets, as this is a social feline who will benefit from the company. That being said, these cats don't fare well if left alone for too long, so make sure your household isn't empty for the majority of the day.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Health</h1>
                        <p>
                            Ukrainian Levkoys are generally considered to be healthy cats; although, they can be predisposed to the same conditions that the Donskoy and Scottish Fold breeds face. As always, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your cat's vet.

                            There aren't any breed specific health problems associated with the Ukrainian Levkoy, but always keep an eye out for signs that your cat might be in distress or pain.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Care</h1>
                        <p>
                            As with all cats, it's important to keep up your Ukrainian Levkoy's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your cat healthy.

                            Beyond scheduling yearly wellness visits with your vet, make sure that you pick up a scratching post for your Ukrainian Levkoy cat's living environment. This can help promote healthy scratching and keep the cat's nails in good condition, which is very important for such an inquisitive mixed breed of cat.

                            The Ukrainian Levkoy cat's ears should be examined regularly for signs of dirt building up or possible infection. Talk to your vet about starting a regular teeth brushing regimen that will suit your Ukrainian Levkoy. Your vet can advise you about specific brands and techniques.

                            Finally, the Ukrainian Levkoy is definitely a mixed breed that will appreciate a cat tree to play and interact with. This can keep the kitty stimulated and will work towards preventing behavior issues from arising.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Coat Color And Grooming</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Ukrainian Levkoy is an almost totally hairless cat who's often said to look like a cute alien creature.

                            When it comes to grooming, hairless cats like the Ukrainian Levkoy require a little extra time and attention. First of all, you'll need to make sure you're feeding your cat a high protein diet so they stay in shape and can regulate their proper body temperature.

                            You'll also want to talk to your vet about feline-friendly sunscreens.

                            Finally, the Ukrainian Levkoy needs bathing at least once a month to regulate the oils that naturally occur on their skin.

                            In terms of climate, most Ukrainian Levkoys need to be kept warm. You might even want to consider purchasing some cat sweaters to make sure your mixed breed cat doesn't get too cold.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Children and Other Pets</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Ukrainian Levkoy is a wonderful fit for families with young kids. Just make sure that early socialization takes place and boundaries are properly set on both sides. Always supervise playtime between young children and cats.
