                        <p>The Lykoi is a natural cat breed cat, which means they developed without the need for human intervention–in this case with the help of a natural mutation! These felines are known for being intelligent, energetic, and loving.

                            You may find these cats in shelters and breed specific rescues, so remember to always adopt! Don’t shop if you’re looking to add one of these cats to your home!

                            The Lykoi is a cat breed that’s affectionately known by fans as the Werewolf Cat! This is due to the half-hairless cat’s striking appearance. It’s a very new breed, too, only being on the scene since 2011. Lykois have quickly picked up a reputation as very smart kitties who possess a strong curiosity streak. This is a cat who will enjoy your attention–and also forms loving bonds with humans.</p>

                        <h1 class="cat_heading">History</h1>
                        <p>
                            If you dig into the history of the Lykoi, you'll find the breed credited to the breeders Brittney and Johnny Gobble along with Patti Thomas. After chancing across some unique looking litters, they let the cats breed, and the Lykoi emerged. The breed's name comes from the Greek word for wolves.

                            The Lykoi is officially acknowledged by the International Cat Association (TICA), and was granted full championship status in 2016.

                            These days, you may find Lykois in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. So make sure to consider adoption if you decide that this is the breed for you!
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Size</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Lykoi is a small- to medium-sized cat. As is always the case, exact size standards might vary.

                            Most Lykoi cats weigh in at four to seven pounds. That said, many may be smaller or larger than average.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Personality</h1>
                        <p>
                            When you find yourself living with a Lykoi, you'll immediately notice just how smart these cats are. As a breed, they're inquisitive, curious and great problem solvers--so you'll want to ensure that you have a stash of interactive cat toys available, plus a batch of play items that are rotated regularly. Keeping your Lykoi mentally stimulated will help bring out the best in this breed's personality.

                            Along with being a super smart kitty--and a feline that you can teach to play games of fetch--the Lykoi is generally an all around energetic cat who loves to stay active. Make sure you have adequate space and scope for climbing missions if you're considering adopting a Lykoi.

                            Fortunately, at the end of a hard day's playing, the Lykoi loves nothing more than to cuddle up with the humans in their life and enjoy some well deserved relaxation time.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Health</h1>
                        <p>
                            Lykois are generally considered to be healthy cats, but it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your cat's vet.

                            There aren't any breed specific health problems associated with the Lykoi, but always keep an eye out for signs that your cat might be in distress or pain. It's also worth nothing that, due to the breed's short history, accurate predictions as to their average lifespan are not yet available.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Care</h1>
                        <p>
                            As with all cats, it's important to keep up your Lykoi's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your cat healthy.

                            Beyond scheduling yearly wellness visits with your vet, make sure that you pick up a scratching post for your Lykoi's living environment. This can help promote healthy scratching and keep the cat's nails in good condition. The Lykoi is such an energetic kitty that it's exceptionally important that their nails are kept in great shape.

                            The breed's ears should also be examined regularly for signs of dirt building up or possible infection. Talk to your vet about starting a regular teeth brushing regimen that will suit your Lykoi. Your vet can advise you about specific brands and techniques.

                            Finally, because the Lykoi is a cat with such high energy levels, it's imperative that you add a cat tree to your home.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Coat Color And Grooming</h1>
                        <p>
                            You'll usually see the Lykoi sporting a signature black or gray coat. Sometimes a silvery shade of white also appears. The breed's roan coat gives it an endearingly patchy appearance.

                            When it comes to grooming, most Lykoi cats are fine with weekly brushing sessions--but make sure that you brush in a gentle fashion so that you don't irritate or hurt the cat's skin. Ask your vet for help on techniques if needed. Also, due to the cat's lack of hair, you'll need to give your Lykoi regular baths to help keep oils in check.

                            In terms of climate, most Lykoi cats are adaptable, although they generally favor warmer temperatures. You should also always make sure that there's enough shade and fresh water available during the hotter months.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Children and Other Pets</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Lykoi cat and young kids are a top notch combination. Your kids will love interacting and forming bonds with a cat that resembles a werewolf! Just make sure that early socialization takes place and boundaries are properly set on both sides--and supervise early interactions between kids and cats.

                            When it comes to other household pets, the good-natured Lykoi fares well with many domestic animals. But always supervise early interactions between the new cat and existing pets. Sometimes these relationships are very much dependent on the individual pets' personalities.

                            Ultimately, early socialization really pays off with this breed. Make sure to reward your Lykoi for good behavior when you bring them home to your family!
