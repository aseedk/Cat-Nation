                        <p>The Peterbald is a mixed breed cat–a cross between the Donskoy and Oriental Shorthair breeds. These felines are known for being affectionate, outgoing, and loyal.

                            The breed gets the “Peter” in the name from Saint Petersburg and the “bald,” of course, from their mostly hairless coats. You may find these cats in shelters and rescues, so remember to always adopt! Don’t shop if you’re looking to add a one of these cats to your home!

                            The Peterbald is a hairless cat who has a reputation as being exceptionally loyal to the humans in their life. This is a breed that will want to be around you and your family all the time, so make sure you can provide enough attention to the cat. Although be warned that, as a hairless breed, these felines require more maintenance than many other cats.

                        <h1 class="cat_heading">History</h1>
                        <p>
                            The story of the Peterbald dates back to 1993 when the Donskoy was bred with the Oriental Shorthair. A new hairless cat emerged, and it was named the Peterbald due to its popularity in the city of Saint Petersburg.

                            Over the years, certain Peterbald cats have been born with a very short coat, so the breed isn't technically always hairless.

                            The Peterbald was officially accepted for championship competition by the International Cat Association (TICA) in 2005.

                            These days, you may find Peterbalds in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. So make sure to consider adoption if you decide that this is the breed for you!
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Size</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Peterbald is a medium-sized cat. As is always the case, exact size standards might vary.

                            Most Peterbalds weigh in at six to ten pounds. Some can be smaller or larger than average.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Personality</h1>
                        <p>
                            First up, you'll instantly notice just how much this breed loves humans. Peterbalds very quickly form super strong bonds with the humans in their lives and will often follow them around from room to room, much in the fashion of a dog.

                            This loyal streak means that the Peterbald also makes a great cat for households with young children. But make sure that you can spend enough time with your Peterbald on a day-to-day basis, as this breed doesn't enjoy being left alone for long periods of the day.

                            While the Peterbald is often hailed as a very affectionate and loving feline, these cats also have a strong athletic streak and will very much enjoy extended play sessions. In many cases, the Peterbald is also said to be a very vocal cat--so be prepared to engage in cat talk conversations with the breed!
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Health</h1>
                        <p>
                            Peterbalds are generally considered to be healthy cats; although, they can be predisposed to the same conditions that the Donskoy and Oriental Shorthair breeds face. As always, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your cat's vet.

                            There aren't any breed-specific health problems associated with the Peterbald, but always keep an eye out for signs that your cat might be in distress or pain.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Care</h1>
                        <p>
                            As with all cats, it's important to keep up your Peterbald's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your cat healthy.

                            Beyond scheduling yearly wellness visits with your vet, make sure that you pick up a scratching post for your Peterbald cat's living environment. This can help promote healthy scratching and keep the cat's nails in good condition.

                            The Peterbald usually has larger-than-normal ears, and they should be examined regularly for signs of dirt building up or possible infection.

                            Talk to your vet about starting a regular teeth brushing regime that will suit your Peterbald. Your vet can advise you about specific brands of toothpaste and brushing techniques.

                            Finally, because the Peterbald is a cat with a decent amount of energy, it's recommended that you add at least one cat tree to your home environment.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Coat Color And Grooming</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Peterbald is usually hairless, although sometimes the breed will posses a very short and almost fuzzy layer of coat. The Peterbald comes in a wide range of colors.

                            When it comes to grooming, a totally hairless Peterbald will require bathing at least once a week. This is to get rid of any oils that accumulate on the skin. Also, consult with your vet about using feline-friendly sunscreen, especially if the cat has access to the outdoors.

                            In terms of climate, most Peterbald cats prefer warmer weather rather than cold environments. It's best to keep the breed indoors so that it can find warm and cosy spots to lounge around in.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Children and Other Pets</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Peterbald is a great fit for families with young children. Just make sure that early socialization takes place and boundaries are properly set on both sides. Supervise early interactions between kids and cats.

                            When it comes to other household pets, the friendly and outgoing Peterbald usually fares well with most other domestic animals. But always make sure to supervise early interactions between the new cat and existing pets, too. Sometimes these relationships are very much dependent on the individuals pets' personalities.

                            Ultimately, early socialization really pays off with this breed. Make sure to reward your Peterbald for good behavior when you bring them home to your family!
