                        <p>The Serengeti is a mixed breed cat–a cross between the Bengal and Oriental Shorthair breeds. These felines are known for being loyal, energetic, and agile.

                            You may find these cats in shelters and breed specific rescues, so remember to always adopt! Don’t shop if you’re looking to add one of these kitties to your home!

                            The Serengeti was bred to resemble a domestic version of the Serval wild cat. As you’d expect, these felines are super athletic and require a lot of daily exercise and play time–which means you’ll also need a large living situation and at least one sizable cat tree. While these cats can be a little shy at first, once they bond with a human, they are super loyal. The breed also has a reputation for being very vocal!

                        <h1 class="cat_heading">History</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Serengeti was originally developed back in the 1990s by Karen Sausman, a biologist and the owner of the Kingsmark Cattery who was attempting to breed a new cat who would look and act like the Serval wild cat, which resides in Africa. The introduction of the Serengeti was intended to help bring awareness to wildlife conservation issues.

                            The Serengeti is officially recognized by the International Cat Association (TICA).

                            These days, you can find Serengetis in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. So make sure to consider adoption if you decide that this is the breed for you!
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Size</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Serengeti is a medium-sized cat breed. As is always the case, exact size standards might vary.

                            Most Serengetis weigh somewhere between eight and 15 pounds. That said, many can be smaller or larger than average.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Personality</h1>
                        <p>
                            When it comes to summing up the Serengeti's personality, the first thing most people notice is just how active and agile these cats are! Befitting the breed's spiritual wild cat ancestry, the Serengeti is exceptionally athletic and loves to spend time climbing up cat trees and furniture, often perching at the top and watching the world around them go by.

                            It goes without saying that you'll need to provide a suitably spacious and varied environment for the Serengeti to live in, and be warned: They love to dart around the home at high speed!

                            Beyond the Serengeti's spirited and energetic nature, they have proved themselves to be a loving breed of cat who forms very strong bonds with the humans they live with. In fact, it's not uncommon for a Serengeti to always follow their humans around!

                            The Serengeti is also a very vocal cat who will happily chat away to their humans.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Health</h1>
                        <p>
                            Serengetis are generally considered to be healthy cats--although it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your cat's vet.

                            There aren't any breed-specific health problems associated with the Serengeti, but always keep an eye out for signs that your cat might be in distress or pain.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Care</h1>
                        <p>
                            As with all cats, it's important to keep up your Serengeti's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your cat healthy.

                            On a day to day basis, it cannot be stressed enough how important it is that your Serengeti is given enough space to run around and climb. This is essential to keeping the breed both healthy and in good spirits--otherwise feline obesity and a sense of frustration at being bored might become an issue.

                            Also, add interactive toys to the home environment to keep this curious kitty mentally satisfied.

                            Along with scheduling yearly wellness vet visits, your Serengeti will need to have their nails checked and trimmed on a regular basis. If you're new to cat adoption, your vet can show you the safest way to carry this out. Adding a scratching post to your living environment can also help promote healthy scratching and keep the cat's nails in good condition.

                            Beyond nail care, examine the Serengeti's ears for signs of dirt building up or possible infection every couple of weeks. It's also advisable to talk with your vet about starting a regular teeth brushing regimen that will suit your Serengeti.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Coat Color And Grooming</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Serengeti's coat is usually seen in either golden or gray colors, but always with its eye-catching leopard-style spots and markings.

                            When it comes to grooming, the Serengeti is a low maintenance feline. Its short and silky coat can be brushed once a week. Doing so will not only help ward off the chance of any mats forming, but also keep the coat in clean and healthy condition. Maintaining a regular brushing routine also helps to lessen the likelihood that hairballs will be an issue for the feline.

                            When it comes to climate, the Serengeti is generally seen as an adaptable cat who can usually live happily in most climates, although they do prefer slightly warmer temperatures. Just remember to always make sure adequate shade and fresh water is provided when the temperature spikes.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Children and Other Pets</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Serengeti is an excellent cat to bring into your home if you already have children, not least because they're a high energy and friendly feline. Just be sure that early socialization takes place and boundaries are properly set on both sides--and supervise early interactions between kids and cats.

                            When it comes to other household pets, the Serengeti is usually okay living alongside other domestic animals. Although you'll want to supervise early interactions between the new cat and existing pets.

                            Ultimately, early socialization really pays off with this breed. Make sure to reward your Serengeti for good behavior when you bring them home to your family!
