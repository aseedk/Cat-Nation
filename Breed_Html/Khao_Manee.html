                        <p>The Khao Manee is a natural cat breed, which means they developed without the need for human intervention. These felines are known for being energetic, smart, and sociable.

                            You can find Khao Manees in shelters and breed specific rescues, so remember to always adopt! Don’t shop if you’re looking to add one of these cats to your home!

                            The Khao Manee has built up a reputation as an outgoing and athletic cat who loves to take part in lengthy play sessions. The breed is a great fit for families with children or other pets, as this is a kitty who will always want to seek out friends and persuade them to start another playtime session. Loneliness can be an issue for these cats, so they do best in active and busy households.</p>

                        <h1 class="cat_heading">History</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Khao Manee has regal roots, originally being kept by royal families in Thailand many centuries ago. In fact, the breed appears in a classic book of cat poetry from the 14th Century called the Tamra Maew!

                            The breed's name translates into English as "White Gem." It's said that the Khao Manee was kept native to Thailand until 1999, when a breeder named Colleen Freymuth decided to bring the cat to the United States of America.

                            These days, you can find Khao Manees in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. So make sure to consider adoption if you decide that this is the breed for you!
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Size</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Khao Manee is a small- to medium-sized cat. As is always the case, exact size standards might vary.

                            Most Khao Manees weigh in at eight to ten pounds. They're usually ten to twelve inches in length when fully grown.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Personality</h1>
                        <p>
                            When it comes to the Khao Manee's personality, you'll instantly realize that this is one super playful and curious cat! This breed will happily play fetch games and never think twice about exploring every nook and cranny of an environment--so make sure you have at least one cat tree installed for the kitty and preferably lots of safe furniture that can be scaled.

                            The breed bonds well with children and other small pets, and will quickly become your kids' best new playmate. Adding on to the Khao Manee's playful side, this is a sociable cat who always wants to be at the center of any action going on. If your home is empty for large parts of the day, the cat could suffer from loneliness.

                            In fact, Khao Manee's have also become known for being very talkative and verbal kitties--so be prepared for many back and forth conversations with your new feline friend!
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Health</h1>
                        <p>
                            Khao Manees are generally considered to be healthy cats--but always schedule regular wellness visits with your cat's vet.

                            One breed-specific health problem that's associated with the Khao Manee is potential deafness. This is actually something that any cat with the combination of a white coat and blue eyes might suffer from.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Care</h1>
                        <p>
                            As with all cats, it's important to keep up your Khao Manee's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your cat healthy.

                            Beyond scheduling yearly wellness visits with your vet, make sure that you pick up a scratching post for your Khao Manee's living environment--this can help promote healthy scratching and keep the cat's nails in good condition.

                            The Khao Manee's ears should also be examined regularly for signs of dirt building up or possible infection. It's also vital to check the cat's skin regularly, especially around the ears, as white cats are often more prone to developing skin cancer.

                            Talk to your vet about starting a regular teeth brushing regimen that will suit your Khao Manee. Your vet can advise you about specific brands and techniques.

                            Finally, for such an active cat, the Khao Manee definitely needs to be provided with enough space to be able to run around and satisfy their exercise needs.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Coat Color And Grooming</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Khao Manee is a white cat. The breed's plain white coat also has the effect of making their eyes stand out and sparkle!

                            When it comes to grooming, most Khao Manee cats are very low maintenance--because this is such a short haired cat, you can get by with brushing them just once a week. This will help lessen the likelihood of hairballs and mats forming.

                            In terms of climate, the Khao Manee generally prefers to be around warmer temperatures rather than cold ones. Although you should always make sure that there's enough shade and fresh water available during the hotter months.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Children and Other Pets</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Khao Manee is a great fit with young children, not least because the breed is so outgoing and playful. Just be sure that early socialization takes place and boundaries are properly set on both sides--and supervise early interactions between kids and cats.

                            When it comes to other household pets, the Khao Manee fares well with many domestic animals, including dogs. Always supervise early interactions between the new cat and existing pets, as well.

                            Ultimately, early socialization really pays off with this breed. Make sure to reward your Khao Manee for good behavior when you bring them home to your family!
