                        <p>
                            The Toyger is a mixed breed cat–a cross between the Bengal breed and Domestic Shorthair tabbies. Affectionate, energetic and playful, these kitties inherited some of the best qualities from both of their parents.

                            You may find these mixed breed cats in shelters and breed specific rescues, so remember to always adopt! Don’t shop if you’re looking to add one of these kitties to your home!

                            Toygers make excellent family cats. Once you see the mixed breed prowling around your home, it will seem like you have a miniature tiger living with you! But while this feline is muscular and athletic, they’re also a very loving and cuddle-some kitty.

                        <h1 class="cat_heading">History</h1>
                        <p>
                            The name of the Toyger is a combination of the words "toy" and "tiger." The mixed breed was originally developed back in the 1980s by Lady Sugden who decided to cross breed a Bengal named Millwood Rumpled Spotskin with a Domestic Shorthair called Scrapmetal in a bid to bring awareness to the issue of tiger conservation. Along the way, a street cat from Kashmir was also involved in the process to help bring out the breed's distinctive tiger-like stripes.

                            In 1993, The International Cat Association (TICA) officially started to register the Toyger.

                            Even though the Toyger got its start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the mixed breed for you!
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Size</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Toyger is a medium-sized cat. As is always the case with newer mixed cat breeds, exact size standards might vary.

                            Most male Toygers weigh in at ten to 15 pounds, and most female Toygers are between seven and ten pounds.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Personality</h1>
                        <p>
                            When it comes to personality, the Toyger is one of the most affectionate and loving cats around. While they have a striking big cat appearance, this is a mixed breed that will love to cuddle up with you for snuggles while you relax on the couch.

                            Befitting such a social cat, the Toyger enjoys human company and having people around--this is a cat who thrives in a busy household rather than one where they're left alone for long periods of time.

                            The Toyger is also a super smart cat who can be trained relatively easily, and the breed is often renowned for taking to outdoor adventures on a safe leash and harness. In fact, in many cases pet owners have trained their Toyger to play games of fetch.

                            Unlike many other cat breeds, the Toyger is also said to enjoy playing with water, just like big cat tigers in the wild!
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Health</h1>
                        <p>
                            Toygers are generally considered to be healthy cats--although the breed can be predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Bengal and Domestic Shorthair face. As always, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your cat's vet.

                            Some of the more common health problems Toygers suffer from include:

                            Obesity
                            Heart murmurs
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Care</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Toyger is a smart, atheltic, and intelligent cat so you'll need to ensure that the mixed breed is kept physically and mentally stimulated. A cat tree or access to furniture they can safely climb up is a must.

                            It's also advisable to provide interactive smart toys that will keep the feline sharp and satisfied. If you consider bringing your Toyger outside, make sure that you use a safe leash and harness and supervise all outdoors sessions.

                            Along with scheduling yearly wellness vet visits, your Toyger will need their nails checked on a regular basis and clipped around once a week. You'll also want to examine the cat's ears for signs of dirt building up or possible infection, and clean them if needed. Your vet can help show you the best practice for this.

                            Also make sure to speak to your regular vet about starting a teeth brushing regimen for your Toyger.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Coat Color And Grooming</h1>
                        <p>
                            The main color of the Toyger's coat is orange or tan with darker vertical stripes. These distinctive stripes can either be broken or they might branch off.

                            The mixed breed is relatively low maintenance when it comes to grooming, with their denser coat only really needing to be brushed once a week. Although, as with all cats, keep a close eye out for any mats that might be starting to develop while you're grooming. Remember, regular brushing will help keep the cat's coat clean and healthy.

                            When it comes to climate, the Toyger is a generally seen as an adaptable cat who can usually live happily in most climates, Just remember to always make sure adequate shade and fresh water is provided when the temperature spikes.
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="cat_heading">Children and Other Pets</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Toyger is a great match with kids. The cat will form strong bonds with the children in your household and become like a new play pal for them. Just be sure that early socialization takes place and boundaries are properly set on both sides--and supervise early interactions between kids and cats.

                            When it comes to other household pets, the Toyger is also usually fine around other domestic animals. Although you'll want to make sure you oversee early interactions when introducing the cat to your household.

                            Ultimately, early socialization really pays off with this mixed breed. Make sure to reward your Toyger for good behavior and adhere to a proper training regimen when you bring them home to your family.
